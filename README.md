## My repo for all my python progress...

For the file Download.py you will need to put in the fields required below for the script to run properly

Fields such as:
  -Your email
  -Your password for your email
  -The SMTP info your email uses
  -And the port used for your smtp server

And that's pretty much it, thanks for stopping by!
