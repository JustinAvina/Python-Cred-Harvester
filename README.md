# Python-Scripts

## My repo for all my python progress...

For the file Download.py you will need to put in the fields required below for the script to run properly

Fields such as:
  * Your email,
  * Your password for your email,
  * The SMTP info your email uses,
  * And the port used for your smtp server.

And that's pretty much it! thanks for stopping by!
